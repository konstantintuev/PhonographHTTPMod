## Description

Modified version of my favorite music player - Phonograph, which supports song and volume control over LAN.

Added NanoHTTPD and Websockets for static auto updated webpage accessible when devices are on same WiFi or connected to hotspot.

Tested on Sony Xperia Z with Android 7.1.1 with 2 devices connected(Android and iOS) over Hotspot for 7 hours without problems.
The Sonyâ€™s battery percentage went from 90% to 50%.

This project may or may not be updated.

Made for one night because of a long car trip.
